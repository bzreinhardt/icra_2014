abstract = {The potential spacecraft contaminants in the exhaust plume of a 0. 89N (0.2 lbf) monopropellant hydrazine thruster were measured in an ultrahigh vacuum molecular sink facility. The engine plume was directed toward five quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs) located at angles of approximately 0, + or - 15, and + or - 30 degrees with respect to the nozzle centerline. The crystal temperatures were controlled such that the mass adhering to the crystal surface at temperatures of from 106 K to 256 K degrees could be measured. Thruster duty cycles of 25 ms on/5 seconds off, 100 ms on/10 seconds off, and 200 ms on/20 seconds off were investigated. The change in contaminant production with thruster life was assessed by subjecting the thruster to a 100,000 pulse aging sequence and comparing the before and after contaminant deposition rates. The predominant contaminant at a surface temperature of 106 degrees K was postulated to be ammonia, while water and undecomposed hydrazine probably represent the primary constituents remaining on a surface at 144 degrees K. The deposits on higher temperature surfaces were much more difficult to characterize, but small amounts of water and hydrazine, which subsequently revaporize, hydrazine compounds, and aniline or aniline-derived hydrocarbons are likely candidates. Duty cycle appeared to have little effect on contaminant production except as the duty cycle influenced the average propellant flowrate. A decrease in the contaminants measured by the 144 degrees K surface and an increase in deposits on the 172 K and 200 degrees K surfaces were noted as the thruster was aged.  },

abstract = {The Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM), known as "Dextre", is Currently slated to launch in February 2008 for deployment oil the International Space Station (ISS) as the final component of Canada's Mobile Servicing System (MSS). Dextre's primary role on the Space Station is to perform repair and replacement (R\&R) maintenance tasks on robotically compatible hardware such as Orbital Replaceable Units (ORUs), thereby eventually easing the burden on the ISS crew. This burden on the on-orbit crew translates practically into crew time being a limited resource on the ISS, and as such, finding ways to assist the crew in performing their tasks or offloading the crew completely when appropriate is a bonus to the ISS program. This is already accomplished very effectively by commanding as many non-critical robotics tasks as possible, such as powering up and free-space maneuvering of the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS), known as "Canadarm2", from the Ground. Thus, beyond its primary role, and based on an increasing clarity regarding the challenges of external maintenance on the ISS, Dextre is being considered for use in a number of ways with the objective of improving ISS operations while reducing and optimizing the use of crew time through the use of ground control for various tasks, pre-positioning hardware, acting as a temporary storage platform to break ail Extra Vehicular Activity (EVA) day into manageable timelines, and extending the physical reach and range of the Canadarm2. This paper discusses the planned activities and operations for Dextre an rationale for how these will help optimize the use of crew resources on the ISS. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A major technical difficulty has been the problem of control of the robotic manipulators mounted onto a freeflying platform in space. The problem of control is directly related to the fact that manipulator motions exert reaction effects on the mounting spacecraft. A solution to this problem is outlined-one in which no fuel is expended and that demands no excessive computational resources that would otherwise preclude real-time performance.},

abstract = {This paper presents some of the results of an 18-month study into robotic on-orbit servicing (OOS) by the authors for the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR)), which leads the world in this area of space technology development. Rather than dealing with technology issues, however, we deal with issues concerning the potential market (the "demand" side) for OOS. We present the case that robotic OOS is not only commercially feasible, hut also even more strongly assert that it is essential. We consider in particular the recent high incidence of on-orbit failures in geostationary telecommunications platforms. We present the sobering statistics of Such failures, and determine that only OOS can mitigate these and future failures. OOS represents the first space-based commercial opportunity that serves the space industry itself rather than Earth-oriented applications more typical of commercial space activities, and to that end provides the basis for future space infrastructure development.

abstract = {The Engineering Directorate of NASA Johnson Space Center has developed a nanosatellite-class free-flyer intended for future external inspection and remote viewing of human spaceflight activities, including International Space Station (ISS) operations. The Miniature Autonomous Extravehicular Robotic Camera (Mini AERCam) technology demonstration unit has been integrated into the approximate form and function of a flight system. The spherical Mini AERCam free flyer is 7.5 inches in diameter and weighs approximately 10 pounds, yet it incorporates significant additional capabilities compared to the 35 pound, 14 inch AERCam Sprint that flew as a Shuttle flight experiment in 1997. Mini AERCam hosts a full suite of miniaturized avionics, instrumentation, communications, navigation, imaging, power, and propulsion subsystems, including two digital video cameras and a high resolution still image camera. The vehicle is designed for either remotely piloted operations or supervised autonomous operations including automatic stationkeeping and point-to-point maneuvering. Free-flyer testing has been conducted on an air-bearing table and in a six degree-of-freedom closed-loop orbital simulation. The orbital simulation models the three-dimensional dynamics of the free-flyer in proximity to the ISS, and produces corresponding God's eye views and simulated free-flyer camera views. A high-fidelity simulation is achieved by directly interfacing to free-flyer thruster driver signals, emulating the MEMS gyro responses in hardware, and using the "truth" state to drive a GPS signal generator connected to the free-flyer GPS receiver.},

abstract = {Spacecraft are still the only complex engineering systems without routine maintenance, repair, and upgrade infrastructure. Whereas the technologies for autonomous on-orbit servicing of satellites are emerging, no general conclusions have yet been drawn regarding the cost effectiveness of on-orbit servicing for space systems. The traditional approach to this problem has been to compare the potential cost savings from servicing to the estimated cost of a chosen servicing architecture. A general model is proposed that applies this approach to a large trade space of space missions and servicing infrastructures. When typical results are analyzed, it demonstrates two major limitations of the conventional approach. First, the servicing cost uncertainty is too high to yield meaningful, conclusions. Second, this approach does not take into account the flexibility provided by on-orbit servicing to space systems. A new perspective on on-orbit servicing is then proposed. The value of servicing, defined as the maximum price under which on-orbit servicing would be interesting, is studied independent from its cost. In addition, a framework to quantify the value of the flexibility provided by on-orbit servicing to space systems is developed. This framework can be used to identify the space missions for which on-orbit servicing would offer the most potential and should serve as a guide to future technology development.},

abstract = {There exist many methods of adding damping to a vibrating structure; however eddy current damping is one of few that can function without ever coming into contact with that structure. This magnetic damping scheme functions due to the eddy currents that are generated in a conductive material when it is subjected to a time changing magnetic field. Due to the circulation of these currents, a magnetic field is generated, which interacts with the applied field resulting in a force. In this manuscript, an active damper will be theoretically developed that functions by dynamically modifying the current flowing through a coil, thus generating a time-varying magnetic field. By actively controlling the strength of the field around the conductor the induced eddy currents and the resulting damping force can be controlled. This actuation method is easy to apply and allows significant magnitudes of forces to be applied without ever coming into contact with the structure. Therefore, vibration control can be applied without inducing mass loading or added stiffness, which are downfalls of other methods. This manuscript will provide a theoretical derivation of the equations defining the electric fields generated and the dynamic forces induced in the structure. This derivation will show that when eddy currents are generated due to a variation in the strength of the magnetic source, the resulting force occurs at twice the frequency of the applied current. This frequency doubling effect will be experimentally verified. Furthermore, a feedback controller will be designed to account for the frequency doubling effect and a simulation performed to show that significant vibration suppression can be achieved with this technique.},

abstract = {The geostationary orbit (GEO), a unique satellite orbit of the human beings, is a very precious orbit resource. However, the continuous increasing of GEO debris makes the GEO orbit more and more crowded. Moreover, the failures of GEO spacecrafts will result in large economic cost and other bad impacts. In this paper, we proposed a space robotic servicing system, and developed key pose (position and orientation) measurement and control algorithm. Firstly, the necessity of orbit service in GEO was analyzed. Then, a servicing concept for GEO non-cooperative targets was presented and a universal space robotic servicing system was designed. The system has a 2-DOF docking mechanism, a 7-DOF redundant manipulator and a set of stereo vision, in addition to the traditional subsystems of a spacecraft. This system can serve most existing satellites in GEO, not requiring specially designed objects for grappling and measuring on the target. The servicing contents include: (a) visual inspecting; (b) target tracking, approaching and docking; (c) ORUs (Orbital Replacement Units) replacement; (d) Malfunctioned mechanism deploying; (e) satellites life extension by taking over its control, or re-orbiting the abandoned satellites. As an example, the servicing mission of a malfunctioned GEO satellite with three severe mechanical failures was designed and simulated. The results showed the validity and flexibility of the proposed system. (C) 2011 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
