abstract = {The Engineering Directorate of NASA Johnson Space Center has developed a nanosatellite-class free-flyer intended for future external inspection and remote viewing of human spaceflight activities, including International Space Station (ISS) operations. The Miniature Autonomous Extravehicular Robotic Camera (Mini AERCam) technology demonstration unit has been integrated into the approximate form and function of a flight system. The spherical Mini AERCam free flyer is 7.5 inches in diameter and weighs approximately 10 pounds, yet it incorporates significant additional capabilities compared to the 35 pound, 14 inch AERCam Sprint that flew as a Shuttle flight experiment in 1997. Mini AERCam hosts a full suite of miniaturized avionics, instrumentation, communications, navigation, imaging, power, and propulsion subsystems, including two digital video cameras and a high resolution still image camera. The vehicle is designed for either remotely piloted operations or supervised autonomous operations including automatic stationkeeping and point-to-point maneuvering. Free-flyer testing has been conducted on an air-bearing table and in a six degree-of-freedom closed-loop orbital simulation. The orbital simulation models the three-dimensional dynamics of the free-flyer in proximity to the ISS, and produces corresponding God's eye views and simulated free-flyer camera views. A high-fidelity simulation is achieved by directly interfacing to free-flyer thruster driver signals, emulating the MEMS gyro responses in hardware, and using the "truth" state to drive a GPS signal generator connected to the free-flyer GPS receiver.},

@article{Ellery2008,
abstract = {This paper presents some of the results of an 18-month study into robotic on-orbit servicing (OOS) by the authors for the German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum fur Luft und Raumfahrt (DLR)), which leads the world in this area of space technology development. Rather than dealing with technology issues, however, we deal with issues concerning the potential market (the "demand" side) for OOS. We present the case that robotic OOS is not only commercially feasible, hut also even more strongly assert that it is essential. We consider in particular the recent high incidence of on-orbit failures in geostationary telecommunications platforms. We present the sobering statistics of Such failures, and determine that only OOS can mitigate these and future failures. OOS represents the first space-based commercial opportunity that serves the space industry itself rather than Earth-oriented applications more typical of commercial space activities, and to that end provides the basis for future space infrastructure development.

@article{Saleh2002,
abstract = {Spacecraft are still the only complex engineering systems without routine maintenance, repair, and upgrade infrastructure. Whereas the technologies for autonomous on-orbit servicing of satellites are emerging, no general conclusions have yet been drawn regarding the cost effectiveness of on-orbit servicing for space systems. The traditional approach to this problem has been to compare the potential cost savings from servicing to the estimated cost of a chosen servicing architecture. A general model is proposed that applies this approach to a large trade space of space missions and servicing infrastructures. When typical results are analyzed, it demonstrates two major limitations of the conventional approach. First, the servicing cost uncertainty is too high to yield meaningful, conclusions. Second, this approach does not take into account the flexibility provided by on-orbit servicing to space systems. A new perspective on on-orbit servicing is then proposed. The value of servicing, defined as the maximum price under which on-orbit servicing would be interesting, is studied independent from its cost. In addition, a framework to quantify the value of the flexibility provided by on-orbit servicing to space systems is developed. This framework can be used to identify the space missions for which on-orbit servicing would offer the most potential and should serve as a guide to future technology development.},

@techreport{BaerwaldR.S.1977,
abstract = {The potential spacecraft contaminants in the exhaust plume of a 0. 89N (0.2 lbf) monopropellant hydrazine thruster were measured in an ultrahigh vacuum molecular sink facility. The engine plume was directed toward five quartz crystal microbalances (QCMs) located at angles of approximately 0, + or - 15, and + or - 30 degrees with respect to the nozzle centerline. The crystal temperatures were controlled such that the mass adhering to the crystal surface at temperatures of from 106 K to 256 K degrees could be measured. Thruster duty cycles of 25 ms on/5 seconds off, 100 ms on/10 seconds off, and 200 ms on/20 seconds off were investigated. The change in contaminant production with thruster life was assessed by subjecting the thruster to a 100,000 pulse aging sequence and comparing the before and after contaminant deposition rates. The predominant contaminant at a surface temperature of 106 degrees K was postulated to be ammonia, while water and undecomposed hydrazine probably represent the primary constituents remaining on a surface at 144 degrees K. The deposits on higher temperature surfaces were much more difficult to characterize, but small amounts of water and hydrazine, which subsequently revaporize, hydrazine compounds, and aniline or aniline-derived hydrocarbons are likely candidates. Duty cycle appeared to have little effect on contaminant production except as the duty cycle influenced the average propellant flowrate. A decrease in the contaminants measured by the 144 degrees K surface and an increase in deposits on the 172 K and 200 degrees K surfaces were noted as the thruster was aged.  },
